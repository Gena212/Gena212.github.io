        <h5>Credit is the #1 medium of exchange in large scale purchases.  If you want to own that beautiful new home but you don't have cash on hand, chances are you are going to need a good credit score to qualify you for the purchase. Your credit score comes from your credit report; it is your spending and repayment report card.  It shares with lender's and merchants your financial acuity, your ability to pay what you borrow. <br><br>Credit reports often aren’t correct, and incorrect information can hurt your score. We want to make sure that you understand your credit report and the information it contains.  We want to equip you with the knowledge to dispute and correct information so you’ll have the highest score possible.</h5>

        <h5>Credit is used to allow a lender to determine your risk level when considering deferred payment options.  Credit allows you to get money upfront with the promise to repay it in the future, often with interest. Creditworthiness refers to a borrower's ability to pay what they've borrowed. Lenders judge creditworthiness in many different ways, and they may use things like credit reports and credit scores to help. <br><br>When you use credit, it usually means using a credit card. It also might mean that you get a loan. A loan is another way to use credit.  Using credit means you borrow money to buy something.<br><br>&emsp;>You borrow money (with your credit card or loan).<br>&emsp;>You buy the thing you want.<br>&emsp;>You pay back that loan later – with interest.
